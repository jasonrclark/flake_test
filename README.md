# Don't Let Your Tests Flake Out

This repository contains examples drawn from my presentation at OS Bridge 2014
about dealing with flaky tests.

Subdirectories all contain a Rakefile, and the example in question can be run
with a simple `rake`.

Comments, additional flaky testing scenarios and tools for rooting out these
type of issues are quite welcome!
